# My Projects
## WarAccademy
Actually, I'm a staffer on [WarAccademy Network](https://github.com/WarAccademy), one of the biggest italian Minecraft servers.
I realize different bots and functions for Telegram, Discord, Minecraft and Linux.
## Telegram
I'm getting better to code Telegram Bots using [pyTelegramBotAPI Library](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI).
### ðŸ“” FastMemo Bot
This is a bot that allow users to create notes using inline mode in any private chat, group or channel.
### ðŸ‘€ ReadConfirmation Bot
This little bot allow users to see who has seen their posts on channels.
